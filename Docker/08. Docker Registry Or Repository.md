# Docker Registry

It is Like Docker Hub but the images are stored where we want to.

The Registry is a stateless, highly scalable server side application that stores and lets you distribute Docker images. The Registry is open-source, under the permissive Apache license. You can find the source code on GitHub.

### Why use it

You should use the Registry if you want to:

-Tightly control where your images are being stored
-Fully own your images distribution pipeline
-Integrate image storage and distribution tightly into your in-house development workflow

## Commands

Run Registry

`docker container run -d -p 5000:5000 --name any_name registry`

When We Run Registry, volume is mounted on that container and if container get stopped we can run new container by attaching same volume by its name and it have Driver 'local' attached to it by default but we can use S3, AWS (shift), google cloud, azure, alibaba etc for driver.

By Default When We push Images It goes to

`docker image tag hub.docker.com/redis:alpine`

But When We Want to Push to Registry

Prepare Image To Push

`docker image tag redis:alpine registry_mapped_url:port/redis:alpine`

`docker image tag redis:alpine 127.0.0.1:5000/redis:alpine`

With Above Command new Image is Created with name

`registry_mapped_url:port/redis`

`127.0.0.1:5000/redis`

Now Push

`docker image push registry_mapped_url:port/redis`

`docker image push 127.0.0.1:5000/redis`

Pull Image from Own Registry

`docker image pull registry_url:port/image_name:tag`

`docker image pull 127.0.0.1:5000/redis:alpine`

### Note : Docker allows only https protocol but it allows 127.0.0.1, except that it doesn't allow any other ip's without https.

To Make allow
--Create daemon.json :`cat daemon.json`
-- Edit It: `vim daemon.json`
-- Move it to docker : `mv daemon.json /etc/docker/`
-- Type :

```
{
"insecure-registries":["ip:port"]
//ip to unblock
}
```

Restart Docker

# Secure Method

-- Remove daemon.json file
-- Restart Docker

-- Make Certificates
`openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -sha256 -keyout /certs/domain.key -x509 -days 365 -out certs/domain.crt`

-- Enter host name on Common Name which is used to pull images eg: repo.docker.local

-- Go to '/etc/docker' and make 'certs.d' dir

-- Go Inside 'certs.d' dir

-- mkdir dir with common_name:port given when generating ssl eg : repo.docker.local:5000

-- Now Copy those certificates on '/etc/docker/certs.d/repo.docker.local\:5000/ca.crt

-- Restart Docker eg `service docker restart`

-- Start Registry : `docker container run -d -p 5000:5000 --name secure_registry -v $(pwd)/certs/:/certs -e REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_CERTIFICATE=/certs/domain.crt -e REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_KEY=/certs/domain.key registry`

-- Create Image to push on that repo : `docker image push repo.docker.local:5000/redis`

--Push : `docker image push repo.docker.local:5000/redis`

### If you get Error like no such host you need to resolve that host

-- Get Your device ip

-- Edit Hosts File `vi /etc/hosts`

-- Add ip and repo.docker.local

--Push Again
