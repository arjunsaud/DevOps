# Docker Registry

It is Like Docker Hub but the images are stored where we want to.

The Registry is a stateless, highly scalable server side application that stores and lets you distribute Docker images. The Registry is open-source, under the permissive Apache license. You can find the source code on GitHub.

### Why use it

You should use the Registry if you want to:

-Tightly control where your images are being stored
-Fully own your images distribution pipeline
-Integrate image storage and distribution tightly into your in-house development workflow
