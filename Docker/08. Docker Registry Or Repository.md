# Docker Registry

It is Like Docker Hub but the images are stored where we want to.

The Registry is a stateless, highly scalable server side application that stores and lets you distribute Docker images. The Registry is open-source, under the permissive Apache license. You can find the source code on GitHub.

### Why use it

You should use the Registry if you want to:

-Tightly control where your images are being stored
-Fully own your images distribution pipeline
-Integrate image storage and distribution tightly into your in-house development workflow

## Commands

Run Registry

`docker container run -d -p 5000:5000 --name any_name registry`

When We Run Registry, volume is mounted on that container and if container get stopped we can run new container by attaching same volume by its name and it have Driver 'local' attached to it by default but we can use S3, AWS (shift), google cloud, azure, alibaba etc for driver.

By Default When We push Images It goes to

`docker image tag hub.docker.com/redis:alpine`

But When We Want to Push to Registry

Prepare Image To Push

`docker image tag redis:alpine registry_mapped_url:port/redis:alpine`

`docker image tag redis:alpine 127.0.0.1:5000/redis:alpine`

With Above Command new Image is Created with name

`registry_mapped_url:port/redis`

`127.0.0.1:5000/redis`

Now Push

`docker image push registry_mapped_url:port/redis`

`docker image push 127.0.0.1:5000/redis`
