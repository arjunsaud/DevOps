# Docker Compose

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application's services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

Compose works in all environments; production, staging, development, testing, as well as CI workflows. It also has commands for managing the whole lifecycle of your application:

Start, stop, and rebuild services
View the status of running services
Stream the log output of running services
Run a one-off command on a service
The key features of Compose that make it effective are:

Have multiple isolated environments on a single host
Preserve volume data when containers are created
Only recreate containers that have changed
Support variables and moving a composition between environments

## Commands

### Run Docker Compose : `docker-compose up`

By default it searches for 'docker-compose.yml' file
If we want to run different compose file with different name.

Run : `docker-compose -f filename.yml up -d`

Down : `docker-compose -f filename.yml down`

Or

Run : `docker-compose -f filename.json up -d`

Down : `docker-compose -f filename.json down`

If we run above command one it run compose file and runs container as specified but if we hit same command again it looks compose file and only changes are done .

### To stop docker compose : `docker compose down `

## Steps for Writing Docker Compose file

It is not necessary to write compose file in yml. we can write in json format also

```
version : '3'
//for defining version of compose file

services:
// service is for defining applications
  web:
  //here web is app
    build: .
    // this takes Dockerfile to make image
    ports:
    //used to port mapping
      - "8000:5000"

  redis:
  //this is another app
    image: "redis:alpine"
    //if not build command then used image
```

## Docker Compose Basic Commands

### To Create (create)

`docker-compose create`

Create is now deprecated use alternative :

`docker-compose up --no-start`

### TO Remove (rm)

`docker-compose rm`

### To Start Container of docker compose

`docker-compose start`

### To stop container from docker compose

`docker-compose stop`

Note: These above commands does not do anything with network but rm command remove volume

# To learn

`docker-compose images`

### To List containers and their status

`docker-compose ps`

### To Pause/Unpause all Containers created from Compose file

`docker-compose pause`

`docker-compose unpause`

### To Start all Containers created from Compose file

`docker-compose start`

### To Kill all Containers created from Compose file

`docker-compose kill`

### To See port of Containers created from Compose file

`docker-compose port service_name port`

`docker-compose port web 5000`

Service Can Be of any Name

Here We use port to see to which our machine port is mapped to

Eg: Here in below the 'web' service has port 5000 and it is mapped to port 8000 of our machine port

```
version : '3'

services:
  web:
  //here web is app
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:5000"
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"
```

### To See log all Containers created from Compose file

`docker-compose logs -f`

### exec for all Containers created from Compose file

This exec command is executed inside running container

`docker-compose exec service_name any_linux_command`

service_name is services defined in compose file

`docker-compose exec web ls`

or

`docker-compose exec web pwd`

### run for all Containers created from Compose file

This run command created new container of same service and executed on it and get exited. The status of that container will be exited after command executed

`docker-compose run service_name any_linux_command`

service_name is services defined in compose file

`docker-compose run web ls`

or

`docker-compose run web pwd`

### To Restart all Containers created from Compose file

`docker-compose restart`

### To Pull all Containers created from Compose file

It pulls all containers eg : it pulls all service created by compose file

`docker-compose pull`

### To Push all Containers created from Compose file

It push all containers to docker hub , all service created by compose file

`docker-compose push`

### Scale Command on all Containers created from Compose file

Eg of docker-compose file :

```
version: '3'
services:
  app1:
    image:nginx

  app2:
    image:nginx
```

`docker-compose scale service_name=any_number service_name2=any_number`

`docker-compose scale app1=2 app2=3`

This command create 2 container of app1 and 3 container of app2.
This is because we can use nginx load balancer so that we can distribute traffic.

### Top Command on all Containers created from Compose file

`docker-compose top`

This command view all running process of the all container created by docker compose file

`docker-compose help`

## To See Version

`docker-compose version`
