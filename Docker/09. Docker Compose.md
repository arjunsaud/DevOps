# Docker Compose

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application's services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

Compose works in all environments; production, staging, development, testing, as well as CI workflows. It also has commands for managing the whole lifecycle of your application:

Start, stop, and rebuild services
View the status of running services
Stream the log output of running services
Run a one-off command on a service
The key features of Compose that make it effective are:

Have multiple isolated environments on a single host
Preserve volume data when containers are created
Only recreate containers that have changed
Support variables and moving a composition between environments
